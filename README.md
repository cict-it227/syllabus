# Introduction to Game Programming Syllabus

* **Course:** [IT 227, WVSU IICT](http://wvsu.edu.ph)
* **Instructor:** Mark Joseph J. Solidarios, [mjsolidarios@wvsu.edu.ph](mjsolidarios@wvsu.edu.ph)

## Course Description

Learn the basics and the best practices in cross platform game programming. Topics include HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript programming, use of different HTML5 game engines and JavaScript libraries, basic 2D and 3D game design concepts, version control, game programming in Blender and strategies in marketing your game.

Computers are provided in the lab but have plenty of limitations especially when it comes to local or external disks access, network sharing is also prohibited so you are encouraged to bring a laptop for in-class exercises.

## Prerequisites

### HTML5 Game Programming
* Basic to advance knowledge in JavaScript.
* Knowledge of HTML and CSS
* Basic jQuery knowledge is a plus

### Blender Game Engine Programming
* Basic knowledge of 3D modeling and animation.
* Basic to advance knowledge of Python programming.

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts.

### Instructor

* The following statements were taken from [Advanced JS](https://github.com/advanced-js/syllabus).
Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

### Reminders
* Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
