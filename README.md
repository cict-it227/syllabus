* Game design and mechanics
* Game assets and prefabs
* World/Level Design
* Game objects and prefabs interaction/manipulation
* Game Programming
* Game events such as triggers, time and collisions
* User Interface for Games, HUDs
* Virtual and Augmented Reality
* Networking
* Platform Development

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides, videos and demos.

#### Instructor
Mark Joseph J. Solidarios, [mjsolidarios@wvsu.edu.ph](mjsolidarios@wvsu.edu.ph)

#### F1: Need Help?
* [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/iict-it227/iict-gamedevs-f1?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)
 * Feel free to ask a question even if no one's around. **DON'T BE SHY!**
 * Message notifications are still sent to listeners.
 * [Email](mailto:mjsolidarios@wvsu.edu.ph) for 1-on-1 help, or to set up a time to meet your teacher at the faculty office.

#### Requirements
* A GitHub account and knowledge of using Git.
* Must demonstrate "good programming style"
 * Use Object-Oriented Programming
 * Functions should be short (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/50655960596/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers))
 * Code should be optimized for readability
 * Source code submissions should be accompanied by a README.md file which include a short description of your work.
* Knowledge of using 2D and 3D multimedia applications.
* Basic understanding of 3D graphics (Modelling, Texturing, Rendering, Animation... etc.).
* Basic knowledge of multi-platform development.

> These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts.

## Homeworks/Projects
> Source code files of homeworks and projects should be submitted here in GitHub.

If you're using GitHub Desktop, [these instructions](https://help.github.com/Desktop/guides/contributing/) will help explain the Git/GitHub concepts. Here are the overall steps:
 1. Fork the assigned repository (will be announced in class).
 1. Clone your forked repository into your hard drive.
 1. Make some changes to your repository.
   - Create your working directory named with your full name **[lastname_firstname]** (if group, your names should be separated by a dash).
   - Copy the contents of the **prefab/boilerplate** into your working directory.
   - Modify your local repository to comply with the task requirements (TBG - to be given).
 1. When you're satisfied with your output, commit your code and push it to your own repository.
 1. Create a pull request to the original repository. If you don't know how, check out [how you can create a pull request on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
 1. Your teacher will evaluate your work, give feedback in the pull request and merge it to the assigned repository once approved.
 1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (TBA - to be announced) â€“ just add a comment in the pull request to let your teacher know it's been updated.

### Reminders
* Laboratory workstations have plenty of limitations especially when it comes to local or external disks access, network sharing is also prohibited so you are encouraged to bring your own Laptop for in-class exercises and practicals.
* Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.
* Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
* Don't forget to check what kind of open source license a source code have. You may want to visit [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com) for more information.
